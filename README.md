# Web AIM Text Client

This is an in-browser chat application which pays homage to AOL instant messenger. It utilizes a preliminary login function and requires two computers / browsers for full operation. The PHP recognizes when two different chatters are queued and facilitates the connection to provide real time chat functionality.
